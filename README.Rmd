# my-first-repository

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is my first repository. 

It contains several folders wit assets: 

- Folder `images` contain bla bla bla  
- Folder `plots` contain bla bla bla

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.

# Metabolomics and nutrition 

Finding biomarkers of **Omega-3** intake in serum and urine as a path to determine if it's possible to relate this diet biomarker with cardiovascular diseases risk. The analytical technique I will employ will be LC (liquid chromatography) coupled to mass spectrometry for samples from a randomized clinical trial.
